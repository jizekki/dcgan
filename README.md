# dcgan
An introduction to research in artificial intelligence by reproducing the results of a scientific article.

# Notes

- Part of the code used in building the Generator and the discriminator was 
inspired by [this github repository](https://github.com/kpandey008/dcgan).
- Checkpoints of the training have been exported to Google Drive. In order to use them, run the part **Load checkpoints from drive** (in the notebook) on Google Colab.
- The obtained results can be visualized in the notebook. When running again, the results may bee different as we are using the standard normal distribution to generate random inputs.
